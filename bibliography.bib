abstract = {In this paper we address the adaptation of applications for conventional platforms (web, tablets and smartphones) to Augmented Reality (AR) settings. We do this on a specific use case, a tool to help users to define drone missions, which has been implemented with equivalent functionalities both for web-enabled devices and AR wearable devices (in particular, HoloLens). First, a brief description of the application workings is presented as well as the creation process for the mission and the manipulation of its components. Then, we present a preliminary validation with 8 users to analyze the degree of acceptance of the AR version, taking the web user interface as a baseline. Despite the technical limitations of the AR version (mainly related to the device visualization constraints and weight) and the reduction in efficiency (tasks need more time to be completed), several users have expressed their preference for this version. However, with the problem of precision in AR Head Mounted Display context always present, the need to establish new interaction techniques is once more highlighted.},

abstract = {In this work, we present a novel mobile computing platfom for mobile ray tracing in which a fast compact hardware accelerator and a flexible programmable shader are combined. Our platform has two key features: 1) an area-efficient parallel pipelined traversal unit; and 2) flexible and high-performance kernels for shading and ray generation. Simulation results show that our platform is potentially a versatile graphics solution for future application processors as it provides a real-time ray tracing performance at full HD resolution that can compete with that of existing desktop GPU ray tracers. Our system is implemented on an FPGA platform, and mobile ray tracing is successfully demonstrated.},
